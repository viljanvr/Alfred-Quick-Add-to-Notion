# Alfred-Quick-Add-to-Notion

This Alfred Workflow lets you quickly add tasks from Alfred to a Notion database using the Notion API. It will automatically parse dates written on different formats. 

To get the automation to work you need to retrive an `Internal Integration Token` and the `Database-ID` from Notion. Some changes in the Workflow may be required to suit your Notion setup (se [Notion API documentation](https://developers.notion.com/reference/property-value-object)).

The Workflow can be downloaded [here](/Quick%20Add%20to%20Notion.alfredworkflow).
